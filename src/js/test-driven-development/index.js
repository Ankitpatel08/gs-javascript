/**
 * Test Driven Development : Writing test for code before writing the code
 * :: ensure code quality
 * Pros: clarify thinking, improves communication among developers, helps in create loosly coupled functions
 * Cons: takes longer to write, Bad tests
 * 
 * TDD Cycle: write failing test -> write production code to make test pass -> refactor the code written
 * Loop: Red -> Green -> Refactor
 * 
 * Three types of tests ::
 * 1. Unit test: specific, low level pieces of functionality
 * 2. Integration test: Individual pieces of application work togather
 * 3. End-to-End: Entire application works correctly
 * 
 * :: Framework for Unit testing ::
 * 1. A testing environment/test runner
 * 2. A testing framework : Mocha
 * 3. An assertion library : chai
